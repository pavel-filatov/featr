title: "`featr` package"
output: github_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

`featr` stands for "feature" (oh, really?) and pronounced the same way.
There is a bunch of functions to produce not-so-common tasks such as 
renaming variables in the data frame or list of data frames,
one-hot-encoding with custom parameters etc. 
Please see [Examples](#examples) section

## Installation

To install `featr` please use `devtools`:

```r
devtools::install_github("pavel-filatov/featr")
```

Please note: you may need to install development version of `rlang` package
**before** the installation of `featr`:
```r
devtools::install_github("r-lib/rlang")
```

## Examples 

### `cor_index()` buids a correlation index: it is simply 
```{r}
featr::cor_index(mtcars)
```
